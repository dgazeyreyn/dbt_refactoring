One of the following values: 

| Field name                            | Type           | Comments
|----------------                       |-------------   | -------------
| Stat_datetime                         | TIMESTAMP      | Date/time that a User Signup or Trial Converted event occurred; IMPORTANT: Appears to be in EST and will need to be converted to UTC in order to be compatible with log_visitor and log_tests.
| Goal_name                             | STRING         | Will be one of either `User Signup` or `Trial Converted`
| Country_name                          | STRING         | Date/time that a User Signup or Trial Converted event occurred
| Stat_ad_id                            | STRING         | Unique ID for a user assigned by BetterHelp. Note that this unique ID will be duplicated across two rows for a user who both signs up and converts.
| Stat_affiliate_info1                  | STRING         | This records the originating site/application where: md = Mind Diagnostics, pm = Pridemind, fm = Faithfulmind, rd = Relationship Diagnostics

| Stat_affiliate_info4                  | STRING         | Records test that user came from (if from a results screen), blank otherwise; Itâ€™s possible that a user can come from Google Ads - and so have a gclid assigned - but signup via a listing page rather than a results page.
