# Refactoring SQL for Modularity

## Background

As part of a client project, I'd created a number of BigQuery queries in support of downstream exploratory data analysis. Around this time, I'd just completed a dbt Cloud course entitled "Refactoring SQL for Modularity" (https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/refactoring-sql-for-modularity). As a learning exercise, I decided to apply the fundamentals learned to my client project.

Here is a list of the steps I followed as part of this process:
1. Migrating Legacy Code
2. Implementing Sources
3. Choosing a Refactoring Strategy
4. CTE Groupings and Cosmetic Cleanups
5. Centralizing Logic in Staging Models
6. CTEs or Intermediate Models
7. Final Model
8. Auditing
